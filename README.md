# Tauri GitHub Action (for JIÎ›music)

This GitHub Action builds your Web application as a Tauri native binary for macOS, Linux and Windows.
If your project doesn't include the Tauri files, we create it at compile time, so if you don't need to use Tauri's API, you can just ship native apps through this Action.

# Usage

This GitHub Action has three main usages: test the build pipeline of your Tauri app, uploading Tauri artifacts to an existing release, and creating a new release with the Tauri artifacts.

## Testing the Build

```yml
name: 'test-on-pr'
on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  test-tauri:
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        platform: [macos-latest, ubuntu-20.04, windows-latest]

    runs-on: ${{ matrix.platform }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: setup node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 16
      - name: install Rust stable
        uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable
      - name: install dependencies (ubuntu only)
        if: matrix.platform == 'ubuntu-20.04'
        run: |
          sudo apt-get update
          sudo apt-get install -y libgtk-3-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev libappindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev patchelf
      - name: install frontend dependencies
        run: yarn install # change this to npm or pnpm depending on which one you use
      - uses: tauri-apps/tauri-action@v0
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Creating a release and uploading the Tauri bundles

In this example `tauri-action` will create the GitHub release itself. It will build and upload the app bundles to the newly created release.

This is generally the simplest way to release your Tauri app.

```yml
name: 'publish'
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - release

jobs:
  publish-tauri:
    permissions:
      contents: write
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        platform: [macos-latest, ubuntu-20.04, windows-latest]

    runs-on: ${{ matrix.platform }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: setup node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 16
      - name: install Rust stable
        uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable
      - name: install dependencies (ubuntu only)
        if: matrix.platform == 'ubuntu-20.04'
        run: |
          sudo apt-get update
          sudo apt-get install -y libgtk-3-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev libappindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev patchelf
      - name: install frontend dependencies
        run: yarn install # change this to npm or pnpm depending on which one you use
      - uses: tauri-apps/tauri-action@v0
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          tagName: app-v__VERSION__ # the action automatically replaces \_\_VERSION\_\_ with the app version
          releaseName: 'App v__VERSION__'
          releaseBody: 'See the assets to download this version and install.'
          releaseDraft: true
          prerelease: false
```

## Uploading the artifacts to a release

`tauri-action` can also upload app bundles to an existing GitHub release. This workflow uses different actions to create and publish the release. `tauri-action` will only build and upload the app bundles to the specified release.

```yml
name: 'publish'

on: pull_request

jobs:
  create-release:
    permissions:
      contents: write
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    outputs:
      release_id: ${{ steps.create-release.outputs.result }}

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: setup node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 16
      - name: get version
        run: echo "PACKAGE_VERSION=$(node -p "require('./package.json').version")" >> $GITHUB_ENV
      - name: create release
        id: create-release
        uses: actions/github-script@v6
        with:
          script: |
            const { data } = await github.rest.repos.createRelease({
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              tag_name: `app-v${process.env.PACKAGE_VERSION}`,
              name: `Desktop App v${process.env.PACKAGE_VERSION}`,
              body: 'Take a look at the assets to download and install this app.',
              draft: true,
              prerelease: false
            })
            return data.id

    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:

        run: yarn install # change this to npm or pnpm depending on which one you use
      - uses: tauri-apps/tauri-action@v0

              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              release_id: process.env.release_id,
              draft: false,
              prerelease: false
            })
```

## Inputs

# Caveats

- You can use this Action on a repo that doesn't have Tauri configured. We automatically initialize Tauri before building, and configure it to use your Web artifacts.
  - You can configure the project initialization with the `distPath` and `iconPath` options.
  - If you need to further customize the default `tauri.conf.json` file you can add a custom config that will be merged with the default one at build time.
    - `args: --config custom-config.json`
- You can run custom Tauri CLI scripts with the `tauriScript` option. So instead of running `yarn tauri <COMMAND> <ARGS>` or `npm run tauri <COMMAND> <ARGS>`, we'll execute `${tauriScript} <COMMAND> <ARGS>`.
  - Useful when you need custom build functionality when creating Tauri apps e.g. a `desktop:build` script.
  - `tauriScript` can also be an absolute file path pointing to a `tauri-cli` binary. The path currently cannot contain spaces.
- If you want to add additional arguments to the build command, you can use the `args` option. For example, if you're setting a specific target for your build, you can specify `args: --target your-target-arch`.
- When your Tauri app is not in the root of the repo, use the `projectPath` input.
  - Usually it will work without it, but the action will install and use a global `@tauri-apps/cli` installation instead of your project's CLI which can cause issues if you also configured `tauriScript` or if you have multiple `tauri.conf.json` files in your repo.
  - Additionally, relative paths provided via the `--config` flag will be resolved relative to the `projectPath` to match Tauri's behavior.
- If you create the release yourself and provide a `releaseId` but do not set `tagName`, the download url for updater bundles in `latest.json` will point to `releases/latest/download/<bundle>` which can cause issues if your repo contains releases that do not include updater bundles.
